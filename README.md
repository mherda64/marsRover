# Mars Rover

Mars Rover game writen in C++ using OpenGL (GLFW, GLAD, GLM, ASSIMP) as a university project. 3D models created using Blender. Right now allows just for driving with the rover on uneven terrain and provides basic collisions with in-game objects (XZ plane circle collisions). Base for some further development and adding some gameplay, such like shooting projectiles, enemies, health points.
